# Shopit
Shopit is an educational shopping simulator to teach primary school children financial literacy with elementary level mathematics skills. The project spans around the storyline of a mother asking the child to help her with grocery chores by giving a shopping list and sufficient, if not, more than enough allowance. Given the storyline, the project was then further extended to defining the core objectives which are to create a web-based application in a simulation form to be used as a practical learning tool while at the same time allowing the children a sense of financial responsibility.

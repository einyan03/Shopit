# Shopit
An educational shopping simulator to teach primary school children financial literacy with elementary level mathematics skills

### Scope
Shopit is an interactive shop simulator mobile application that spans around the storyline of a mother asking the child to help her with grocery chores by giving a shopping list and sufficient, if not, more than enough allowance. Given the storyline, the project is then extended to defining the core objectives which are to create a web-based application in a simulation form to be used as a practical learning tool while allowing the children a sense of financial responsibility.

The project is developed using Vue javascript framework on AWS Cloud9 environment. From the project initiation to execuation stages, the agile model is considered bypassing
the limitations that are seen in most traditional development approaches such as the waterfall model. One of the reasons the agile model is mainly considered to be adopted was due to the instantaneous feedback and changes that require strategic planning and communication at every step of the process and the team.

The RC version of the application can be found at http://shopit.iliil.com/shopit-0.2.7/.
